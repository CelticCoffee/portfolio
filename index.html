Keep Learning</h3> <p class=aboutwjgDesign>I am a front end developer, which means that I can work on applications and as a part of a team but I can also build YOU an awesome website. I enjoy solving problems, especially when they relate to helping people. I use HTML, CSS and Javascript and am completely delighted by websites and applications that have a unique and beautiful user experience. I&#39;m a mom, an avid outdoorswoman, coffeephile and classically trained violinist. I do most of my internet browsing on my phone and I bet you do too so let&#39;s by all means make sure your website looks amazing on a variety of devices. Check out my recent work below ranging from some custom Wordpress to a full stack Javascript application.

I enjoyed working with an impressive team including designers from Splash International and programming guru Al Zimmerman of Pragmatic Design Studio. The greatest challenge in realizing the design for this site was scaling images properly so that they don&#39;t take years to load and so that there are clean lines throughout the page in spite of the various image sizes. </p> </div> </div> <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-lg-4"> <div class=thumbnail> <div class=caption> <h3><a href=http://www.cathedral-or.org target=_blank>Cathedral School</a></h3> </div> <a href=http://www.cathedral-or.org target=_blank><img src=images/cathedralSampleSiteHome.png alt="cathedral school site"></a> <div class=testSlider> <div> <p class="projectText cathedralSlide2"> &#34;Wendy&#39;s flexibility and ability to overcome obstacles make her an absolute dream to work with.

The website is responsive--meaning that it looks great on a variety of devices ranging from iPhones to desktop screens. This is important for any business but with busy parents frequently grabbing information off their mobile phones having a really great responsive design is especially important for this website.<br>Another priority is easy integration of tools that parents are already familiar with such as google calendars.</p> <div class=centered> <h5 class=backToCathedral>Back</h5> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-lg-4"> <div class=thumbnail> <div class=caption> <h3><a href="http://winecountryweddingpros.com/" target=_blank>Wine Country Wedding Professionals</a></h3> </div> <img src=images/wineCountryweddingProsSampleWork.png alt=...> <p class=projectText>These wedding industry professionals are a wonderful group of passionate and creative small business owners who have established a collective to reach out to couples getting married in the Yamhill Wine region. The group is under new management and the previous website was actually hacked so when I created this site, I made it a priority to establish great security measures. <br><br>These folks are busy running their businesses and they don&#39;t have tons of time to spend maintaining a website so I focused on creating a website that is easy to update but will look great even as is.</p> </div> </div> <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-lg-4"> <div class=thumbnail> <div class=caption> <h3><a href=http://cahlab.com target=_blank>the Hunt Lab at UCSF</a></h3> </div> <a href="http://celticcoffee.github.io/huntLab/" target=_blank><img src=images/huntLabSample.png alt="Hunt Lab UCSF image"></a> <p class=projectText>For the Hunt Lab, I have implemented some tools such as a custom coded search box that allows visitors to search in a dictionary on the site.<br><br> Many search features one finds on websites will produce a Google search result--not limited to the information on the website where the search was instigated.

However, recently with some exciting career advancements, she was looking for a few more professional touches to her online look and hoping to spend less time working on her website and more time working on her music. <br>I created a (customized) WordPress Child Theme which allows Naomi to keep her content extremely current for her fans. I integrated third party music and promotion apps including Garage Band, Reverb Nation and Youtube so that fans can easily stream and purchase her incredible music.<br>Stay tuned for more social media integration coming soon.</p> </div> </div> <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4"> <div class=thumbnail> <div class=caption> <h3><a href=http://www.cathedral-or.org target=_blank>Cathedral School</a></h3> </div> <a href=http://www.cathedral-or.org target=_blank><img src=images/cathedralSampleSiteHome2.png alt="cathedral school site"></a> <div class=testSlider> <div> <p class="projectText cathedralSlide2"> &#34;Wendy&#39;s flexibility and ability to overcome obstacles make her an absolute dream to work with.

Some of the website's unique features include a single page effect that handles a lot of content thoughtfully, integration of Google Calendar to allow busy parents to stay on top of the school's many events, a fully responsive site and photo gallery carousel on the home page that I built with JavaScript. The school has scene a jump in enrollment inquiries since the site went live thanks to the SEO (Search Engine Optimization) that I implemented.</p> <div class=centered> <h5 class=backToCathedral>Back</h5> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4"> <div class=thumbnail> <div class="caption centered"> <h3><a href=http://www.claritymediagroup.net/index.html target=_blank>Clarity Media Group</a><h3> </h3></h3></div> <a href=http://www.claritymediagroup.net/index.html target=_blank><img src=images/clarityMediaSample.png alt="Clarity Media Group Image"></a> <p class=projectText>The Clarity Media Group website features a clean, responsive design.<br>I integrated a really effective contact form that cuts down on spam and has a beautiful, clean look. I also assembled Clarity's extensive portfolio of projects into a beautiful blog-like page including a semi-transparent side navigation bar.

The group is under new management and the previous website was actually hacked so when I created this site, I made it a priority to establish great security measures. <br><br>These folks are busy running their businesses and they don&#39;t have tons of time to spend maintaining a website so I focused on creating a website that is easy to update but will look great even as is.</p> </div> </div> <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4"> <div class=thumbnail> <div class=caption> <h3><a href=http://cahlab.com target=_blank>the Hunt Lab at UCSF</a></h3> </div> <a href="http://celticcoffee.github.io/huntLab/" target=_blank><img src=images/huntLabSample.png alt="Hunt Lab UCSF image"></a> <p class=projectText>For the Hunt Lab, I have implemented some tools such as a custom coded search box that allows visitors to search in a dictionary on the site.<br><br> Many search features one finds on websites will produce a Google search result--not limited to the information on the website where the search was instigated. Obviously this is often not ideal since you want your site visitors to STAY on your site, not leave it.</p> </div> </div> <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4"> <div class=thumbnail> <div class=caption> <h3><a href=https://we-jot.herokuapp.com/signin target=_blank>Jot</a></h3> <h4 class=subtitle> a Full Stack JavaScript Application</h4> <p> created by Wendy Goodwin and Natalie Ogle </p> <ul class=links> <li class=github><a href=https://github.com/Karandashnik/Project-Pencil target=_blank><img src=images/GitHub-Mark-64px.png>Github</a></li> <li class=jot><a href=https://we-jot.herokuapp.com/signin target=_blank><img src=images/jotLogo.png>Website</a></li> </ul> <a href=https://we-jot.herokuapp.com/signin target=_blank><img src=images/jotHome.jpg alt="jot home image"></a> <p class=projectText> Many business scheduling apps exist but most are geared for large corporations.

I enjoyed working with an impressive team including designers from Splash International and programming guru Al Zimmerman of Pragmatic Design Studio. The greatest challenge in realizing the design for this site was scaling images properly so that they don&#39;t take years to load and so that there are clean lines throughout the page in spite of the various image sizes. </p> </div> </div> <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4"> <div class=thumbnail> <div class="caption centered"> <h3><a target=_blank>Effesenden Music</a><h3> </h3></h3></div> <a target=_blank><img src=images/effesendenSampleImage.png alt="Effesenden Music Home"></a> <p class=projectText> Call me one of those scientists who uses herself as a patient . . . but I recently had the chance to create a fresh new look for my own music business website, Effesenden Music. One important thing I did with this site was migrate over nearly 10 years of Wordpress.com blog posts to my new site. I definitely didn't want to lose all of that information that I worked so hard to create before I knew how to code. This is a customized WordPress Child Theme. While the Full Stack JavaScript developer in me wanted to spend ages creating a from scratch web application that would make you a mean mocha while you peruse my music, I knew that WordPress offered the functionality that I needed. Sometimes it is really important NOT to reinvent the wheel. Still, I had a fun time integrating a lot of special touches into the site including thoughtful SEO and other bits of magic. </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="row colorBack"> <div class=col-xs-12> <div class=centered> <button type=button class="btn btn-danger active topBtn"> Top</button>  </div> </div> </div> <div class=footer> <p>Site Designed by Wendy J Goodwin <br> &copy;2016 Wendy J Goodwin Creative</p> </div> </div>  <script>

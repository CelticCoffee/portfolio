            <p class="intro-content">Website Design is the process of creating the look and feel of a website. Design encompasses not only decisions like colors and fonts but also the user experience for visitors to your site which includes things like menus, buttons, the organization of content and the way in which any images will be displayed.<br><br>Beyond the obvious goal of creating beautiful, informative websites, I prioritize Search Engine Optimization (SEO) in my design approach.  <br>Some of the features I emphasize include&#58;</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
              <li>Mobile First and Responsive Design</li>
              <li>Content optimized for fast loading time</li>
              <li>Information is easy to find</li>
              <li>Accessibility for Screen Readers</li>

          <div class="col-xs-12">
          <div class="centered">

            <p class="intro-content">Web Development is all about the technical side of a website.  As a developer, I can engineer a functioning website without depending on existing templates or design programs.  In fact, this website was built from scratch.  Because I understand the whole process, I can also take existing templates, programs and plugins and modify them to fit your unique website needs.<br><br>A good example is a site I recently built in WordPress for a client.  We used an existing template to save time and costs but then I modified the template so that it was very customized.  One of the things we did not like about the template however was the Footer &#40;the content at the very bottom of each page of the website&#41;.  So, I was able to use my developer skills to go into the code and create a modified version of the Footer that worked harder to provide branding and SEO for her site.<br><br>
            You can often find some of what you want in existing code and existing templates but just as YOU and your business are totally unique, your site doesn&#39;t have to be limited by what is currently available.<br><br>
            Even when I&#39;m not using all the cool Full Stack JavaScript I know to work on a site, my development training is incredibly handy for trouble-shooting websites.  I know how to go about finding out what is wrong.<br><br>
            Finally, often external code and plugins have a lot of features beyond what you might need.  That can add up to slower website speed and more vulnerability on your site from hackers. I am very pragmatic when it comes to choosing to integrate existent code when it will benefit your site and writing my own when it will translate to a safer, faster, more effective website for you.

                    <li><strong>HTML5, CSS, SCSS</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>&#34;vanilla&#34; JavaScript&#58;</strong> I like the purity of writing my own functions.  I understand the importance of closures and I know how to write to avoid the notorious global variables that can cause all kinds of unexpected behaviors in a site or application.</li>
                    <li><strong>jQuery&#58;</strong>What can I say&#63; My clients are billed by the hour so knowing when and how to use jQuery can be responsible and respectful to their project budget.  I do not depend on jQuery but I find it useful for speed when a project is open to it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bootstrap&#58;</strong> Handy at times. I like writing my own stylesheets and JavaScript but sometimes Bootstrap is really useful for its pre-existing solutions to frequent website needs like . . . this modal&#33;  Also, Bootstrap creator Mark Otto designed Britney Spears&#39; website.  What more justification would I need to want to use Bootstrap&#63;</li>
                    <li><strong>Backbone&#58;</strong> The JavaScript library that I have coded in most extensively.  Model, Viewer, Controller&#58; separate those concerns for a sleaker app. </li>
                    <li><strong>Node&#58;</strong> Node is so awesome-- I realize there are all those modules that we load in but the actual writing of the code is so sleak. . .so much more concise and elegant than PhP.  </li>
                    <li><strong>Three.js&#58;</strong> &#40;3D JavaScript library&#41; that I love.  Work with equirectangular images and ability to create interactive JavaScript hotspots within an immersive scene.</li>

                    <li><strong>PHP for WordPress&#58;</strong> I am writing my own plugins and creating modified PHP files in the Child Themes I create for my clients.</li>
                    <li><strong>Templating Languages</strong> including Liquid and Handlebars</li>
                    <li><strong>Command Line and Git version control</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong></li>

            Elvon, Eutology&rsquo;s founder needed a fast turnaround on her site because of pending speaking engagements and I was able to work with her to effectively meet her timeline goals.<br><br>I set up the site with a number of user-friendly tools that allow Elvon to keep her content fresh and gather information from clients.</p>

            <p class="projectText">Naomi LaViolette is a beloved songwriter and pianist living in Portland.  As with many musicians, she has learned a lot about maintaining her online presence over the years.  However, recently with some exciting career advancements, she was looking for a few more professional touches to her online look and hoping to spend less time working on her website and more time working on her music.  <br>I created a (customized) WordPress Child Theme which allows Naomi to keep her content extremely current for her fans. I integrated third party music and promotion apps including Garage Band, Reverb Nation and Youtube so that fans can easily stream and purchase her incredible music.<br>Stay tuned for more social media integration coming soon.</p>

Some of the website's unique features include a single page effect that handles a lot of content thoughtfully, integration of Google Calendar to allow busy parents to stay on top of the school's many events, a fully responsive site and photo gallery carousel on the home page that I built with JavaScript.  The school has scene a jump in enrollment inquiries since the site went live thanks to the SEO (Search Engine Optimization) that I implemented.</p>

The group is under new management and the previous website was actually hacked so when I created this site, I made it a priority to establish great security measures.
              <br><br>These folks are busy running their businesses and they don&#39;t have tons of time to spend maintaining a website so I focused on creating a website that is easy to update but will look great even as is.</p>

                  Many business scheduling apps exist but most are geared for large corporations. Small businesses, particularly sole proprietors have neither the budget nor the time to implement these robust systems. Jot is different because it does one thing and it does it well: offers an intuitive scheduling interface to allow clients and small businesses to easily make and keep track of appointments.

I enjoyed working with an impressive team including designers from Splash International and programming guru Al Zimmerman of Pragmatic Design Studio.  The greatest challenge in realizing the design for this site was scaling images properly so that they don&#39;t take years to load and so that there are clean lines throughout the page in spite of the various image sizes.

            Call me one of those scientists who uses herself as a patient . . .  but I recently had the chance to create a fresh new look for my own music business website, Effesenden Music.  One important thing I did with this site was migrate over nearly 10 years of Wordpress.com blog posts to my new site.  I definitely didn't want to lose all of that information that I worked so hard to create before I knew how to code.  This is a customized WordPress Child Theme.  While the Full Stack JavaScript developer in me wanted to spend ages creating a from scratch web application that would make you a mean mocha while you peruse my music, I knew that WordPress offered the functionality that I needed.  Sometimes it is really important NOT to reinvent the wheel. Still, I had a fun time integrating a lot of special touches into the site including thoughtful SEO and other bits of magic.
